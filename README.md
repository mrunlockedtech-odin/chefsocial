# ChefSocial - Expanding Social Media for Chefs
This project was created out of the frustrating experience of following a recipe from YouTube Shorts, Tiktok, or any other piece of short-form media. Often, you can not view both the recipe, cook times, or other vital information at the same time as the video. Other times, creators may spread information between the video and the description meaning you have to watch and read at the same time. The goal of ChefSocial is to take the information from the video, description, and the comments to make a perfect experience to have all the information available in different formats.

## Getting Started
ChefSocial is currently without any login or account functionality. While this is an Ice Box feature, the implementation will be limited to verified creators, at least for posting content. All users can browse through recipes and creators, in addition to leaving comments.
